    Container's internal SSH ports need to be mapped to Droplet's external ports,
    so that Jenkins could SSH into the Container directly from the Internet. This
    setting sets the starting port for this mapping, e.g. if it's set to value
    of 1500, then the first Container would be mapped to 1500, the second to 1501,
    etc., possibly reusing the ports as containers get created and destroyed.
